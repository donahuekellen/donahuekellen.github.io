![Results](/../assets/images/accuracyplot.png)

Using a basic UNet implementation created by [milesial](https://github.com/milesial/Pytorch-UNet) I've achieved a mean frozen-thaw classification accuracy of 87% for Alaska in 2018. I believe improvements can be made by reimplementing the UNet for my particular problem size since the downscaling of the original implementation only goes to around 32x32 pixels but my original images are only 45x159.
